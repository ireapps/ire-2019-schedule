4575,Immigration Track: Finding the story: Immigration (advanced),"On any given day, about 45,000 people are in immigrant detention, a number that has increased under the Trump administration’s policies and put government facilities at capacity. Prosecutions for illegal entry swamp federal courts, making up about 80 percent of the dockets of cases in districts along the border, and a record of more than 869,000 people are waiting for their cases to be heard in immigration courts, with an average wait time stretching longer than two years. During last year’s family separation crisis, parents were sent to a series of detention centers run by different government agencies while kids were sent to federal shelters run by nonprofits and private companies across the country making billions of dollars while facing little public scrutiny. Meanwhile, more than 12,000 migrant children who traveled here without their parents are in government shelters and the administration is trying to expand its capacity to hold more minors. What are the governmental agencies and private companies that run these facilities? How are they making their money and where are their contracts? And how does the Trump administration’s policies and practices affect the lives of those forced to live in them? Over the past two years, 22 immigrants have died in custody, the highest number since 2009.
