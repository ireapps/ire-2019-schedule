Although the next generation of newsroom employees are on track to be more diverse, the startling lack of present-day diversity requires us to move beyond the idea of recruitment and address a more pressing question: once they’re on our teams, how do we support and retain journalists from underrepresented groups? In this session, you’ll hear from award-winning journalists and hiring editors on how they navigate these conversations, from their own personal experiences to how they are shaping their newsroom cultures to retain the much-needed voices that are missing.

4652,Immigration Track: Covering immigration in the Trump era,"Since President Trump took office promising to curb immigration, the beat has evolved at an overwhelming pace. With a barrage of daily stories coming down the pipeline, it can be hard to decide which ones merit deeper investigation. And reporting in the sprawling yet opaque federal immigration system often feels like digging around in a black hole. A prime example is the administration’s zero tolerance policy, which resulted in thousands of parents and children being separated. Little information was shared even with those bureaucrats who were involved, and much of the process played out hidden from public view. The New York Times’ Caitlin Dickerson, Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting’s Aura Bogado, and the Houston Chronicle’s Lomi Kriel discuss how they have navigated these challenges and offer advice on how to report effectively on tightly kept government secrets.

4575,Immigration Track: Finding the story: Immigration (advanced),"On any given day, about 45,000 people are in immigrant detention, a number that has increased under the Trump administration’s policies and put government facilities at capacity. Prosecutions for illegal entry swamp federal courts, making up about 80 percent of the dockets of cases in districts along the border, and a record of more than 869,000 people are waiting for their cases to be heard in immigration courts, with an average wait time stretching longer than two years. During last year’s family separation crisis, parents were sent to a series of detention centers run by different government agencies while kids were sent to federal shelters run by nonprofits and private companies across the country making billions of dollars while facing little public scrutiny. Meanwhile, more than 12,000 migrant children who traveled here without their parents are in government shelters and the administration is trying to expand its capacity to hold more minors. What are the governmental agencies and private companies that run these facilities? How are they making their money and where are their contracts? And how does the Trump administration’s policies and practices affect the lives of those forced to live in them? Over the past two years, 22 immigrants have died in custody, the highest number since 2009.
